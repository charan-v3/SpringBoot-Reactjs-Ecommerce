# Order History Security and Admin Dashboard Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements and bug fixes implemented for the order management system, ensuring users can only access their own orders and fixing admin dashboard analytics.

## Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Order History Access Control

## Database Security

### Repository Queries
- All customer-specific queries include customer ID validation
- Secure order tracking with proper access control
- Analytics queries for real-time statistics

### Data Isolation
- Customer orders are properly isolated
- Guest orders are handled separately
- Admin queries have full access with proper authorization

## Frontend Security

### Route Protection
- Role-based route protection using ProtectedRoute component
- Separate routes for admin and customer views
- Proper authentication checks

### Component Security
- Authentication-aware API calls
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access
